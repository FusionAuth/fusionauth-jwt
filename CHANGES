FusionAuth JWT Changes

Changes in 3.1.0

 * Added Signer.getKid() with a default impl to throw UnsupportedOperationException(), this allows the JWTEncoder.encode to add a 'kid' by default. This makes it more consistent with the JWTDecoder.

Changes in 3.0.4
 * Add PEM.encode(Certificate certificate) and PEMEncoder.encode(Certificate certificate)

Changes in 3.0.3
 * Remove throws from OpenIDConnect utility methods

Changes in 3.0.2
 * Add JWTUtils.decodePayload and decodeHeader as a utility to decode a JWT, this is an unsafe and should only be used for utility not to verify the JWT.

Changes in 3.0.1
 * Remove un-needed line return at the end of the PEM when encoding a PEM string.

Changes in 3.0.0

 This major version of fusionauth-jwt contains breaking changes.

 * Elliptic Support, ES256, ES384 and ES512
 * JWK Support
 * Some minor breakages
 * Upgraded Jackson from 2.9.6 to 2.9.8. This upgrade addresses CVE-2018-19360, CVE-2018-19361, CVE-2018-19362 and CVE-2018-1000873.

   If you are unable to upgrade to 3.0.0, simply explicitly depend upon version 2.9.8 in your own application, this will be compatible with
   this library.

Changes in 2.1.1
 * Ignore null values when calling JWT.addClaim

Changes in 2.1.0
 * Rename packages from org.primeframework to io.fusionauth
 * Rename project from prime-jwt to fusionauth-jwt

Changes in 2.0.0

 This major version of prime-jwt contains breaking changes to the JWT class to make the behavior more consistent and predictable.

 * JWT parsing now uses BigDecimal and BigInteger for all numeric values. There are helper methods to convert these to Integer, Long, Double and Float.
 * JWT object stores all known claims as top level properties and all other claims in a Map
 * Added helper methods to JWT to get all claims in a Map (including known claims). One is the original JWT values and one provides rich Java types (i.e. ZonedDateTime)
 * Added RSAUtils.convertFingerprintToThumbprint
 * Added RSAUtils.convertThumbprintToFingerprint
 * Added HEXUtils.fromBytes
 * Added HEXUtils.toBytes
 * Upgraded Jackson from 2.8.8 to 2.9.6. This upgrade addresses CVE-2018-7489 and CVE-2017-7525 for jackson-databind.
